…......... GENERAL OVERVIEW--

PROBLEM:	Kenya, being a well-to-do nation is faced by open-daylight discrimination of
			citizens. Some extreme cases report "murder" of "innocent" lives.
			Accidents are bound to occur in unsafe points along national trunks. The victims are sometimes subject
			to pain and some succumb upon delayed aid.

			This software comes in handy since:
		

001:	this product implements the layout of all roads in a country and display current active traffic. 
		It should define traffic patterns and indicate any emergencies instantly for real-time processing of these cases.
		By "processing," we mean handling accidents(and other traffic-related issues) in good time before much harm or loss.

002:	this product is meant to provide room for alerts "by-citizens-for-citizens". This will implement a platform for communication amongst
		the citizens when a situation occurs anywhere in the country.
